5/11/2024

Found out how to report mouse movement/position 
Also figured out how to store location of initial touch
  -I believe it is possible to implement touch scrolling
  
5/16/2024

Very little progress on scrolling, but...
  -Found difference in lines(y) from touch event to drag within order window
  -scrolling mechanic now knows the maximum/minumum index and responds accordingly
  
5/17/2024

Crawling toward scrolling. 
  -Now can find number of lines to scroll from order
  -Each item by default is given three lines 
    -One for name
    -One for quantity and price at given quantity
    -One dotted
  -Additional lines added for mods/keyboard

Items written to order_win now display quantity and price
Still working on scrolling
  -Somewhat working!
  -Only draws lines within min/max range
  -Waits one second before attempting to scroll in case user wants to highlight

5/20/2024

Scrolling working! Still need to do formatting/highlighting

5/23/2024

Been working on a major bug in scrolling. 
  -Scrolling with mods visible too many times broke the get_* functions
  -Didn't segfault, but it made the program unusable
  -Fixed by copying names/prices to the order list directly 
  -Scrolling still does not get the max lines correct when mods are visible
  -Prices now display correctly with mods visible 

5/24/2024

More major scrolling progress! 
  -Completely re-wrote system for tracking which lines are visible on order_win
  -Scrolling now respects the boundaries of order_win even with mods present
  -Still missing some small things 
Current goals are to fix the highlighting format when printing to order_win
and find lines touched in order_win
After those goals are complete, I think some code cleanup is needed 
before going further

5/25/2024

Adding some "niceities" to scrolling 
  -Making sure no blank lines exist unless whole list is < 27 lines
  -This is so we can find an item based on what lines it occupies
Moving scrolling functions to their own source/header files

5/27/2024

Minor code cleanup and comment updates
Fixed small bug with removing mods and scroll index
  -When MAX_LINE was less than 27, scroll_to_end reset the index to an illegal value
Fixed small highlighting bug(s)
  -When scrolling the release of a touch event highlighted the item under cursor position
  -When touching a blank line in order_win, item 0 was highlighted on and off

5/30/2024

Small fix in highlight -- now highlights whole line 

5/31/2024

Small consistency fix in the codebase. 
  -get_itm/get_name/get_mod no longer require char type[]
  -Now using an int to represent the desired menu
  -This fixes recall assigning from incorrect menu(s)
  
6/6/2024

After trying some different strategies to draw a clock settled on setitimer

6/8/2024

Fixed small bug in adding extra charges to items. 

6/10/2024

Small bug fixes and comment updates
  -Fixed formatting for adding charges to items on order_win
  -Fixed charge page reading max page value from mod page
  -Fixed price not being updated after charges/mods deleted

Started building recall menu

6/26/2024

Added return button to recall screen
  -Some changes to drawing/deleting windows
  !!Created segfault on window resize!! -- Fixed 6/27/2024
  
6/27/2024

I believe I fixed the segfault issue for switching screens/resizing window
  -Instead of using ncurses delwin, manually set windows to NULL
  -My assumption is that this prevents deleting a NULL element
  
7/6/2024

Decided I want more srolling. Trying to set it up...

7/7/2024

Setting up recall window scrolling functions
  -Just a clone of scrolling functions for order win
  
7/9/2024

No longer storing touch information in recalldex. (Why keep it in two places?)
Added recalldex_state to track what is visible

7/10/2024

Began writing linked list to hold orders from a given day
  -Using linked list in case orders are non-sequential
  -Also due to unknown number of order files 
Linked list insertion/deletion works 

7/11/2024

Scrolling the recall_win now works
!!Need to write highlight for recall_win!! -- done 7/18/2024
Drew a couple buttons
  -Recall order button
  -Void order button
  -Print order button
  -Search for order button
  -Search date button
 
7/14/2024

Added logic to determine which line in recall-win is selected

7/18/2024

Highlighting is now possible in recall-win
Updated comments for new functions
Orders from current day can now be recalled!

7/20/2024

Orders can be recalled from previous days!
Need to add dialog for which order date is being viewed

7/23/2024

Added an error dialog box 
  -My error messaging before was really more of a debugging function
  -Now a window is drawn with an "OK" button to display errors
  -This is for visibility and consistency 
  
7/24/2024

Fixed a really annoying bug involving scrolling recall_win
  -Previously, after scrolling recall_win, each selection was one
   line under (y+1) what the user attempted to select. 
  -Solution? Changed if((get_recalldex("CURRENT") >= get_recalldex("MIN"))
   to if((get_recalldex("CURRENT") > get_recalldex("MIN"))
   
7/25/2024

Found some major bugs with save_order and recall
  -Extra charges copy extra lines 
    -Extra charges is copying garbage lines before adding extra charge
    -Price is being updated correctly
    -No longer copying garbage line (was an issue with add_mod)
    -Now, recall only recalls one extra charge -- fixed
  -Mods are copied twice (recall only)
    -They were being added in as comments -- fixed
  -Open food value does not copy correctly
    -Open food value displays x2(of_val), but total due is correct
    -Fixed; save_order was implicitly adding open food value to price
    -Recall still does not recall open food price correctly
      -Fixed; implicitly check if value is open food when writing list
      
Now save_order works! But recall still has some bugs
  -Only when recalling an order with an extra charge does there seem 
   to be an issue

7/31/2024

Small breakthrough with recall()
  -No longer using nested while loops
  !!Still a small issue with price reacall?!!
    -Price from recall_details simply takes input from receipt line
     and divides that number by the quantity of said item in the order
     this does not take extra charges into account (save_order still works)
Orders can now be searched for when a day is selected

8/1/2024

Small update to recalling items with extra charges -- now adding correctly
  -except for open food charges
  
8/16/2024

Moving keypad "RIGHT" to be keypad "LEFT" for payment screen

8/19/2024

Drawing some buttons to the cash payment screen

8/26/2024

Added return button to payment screen 
  -!!Keypad is not deleting correctly!! remnents visible
    -Fixed -- delete_keypad() was only deleting if STATE was equal to 2
  -Working on exact change button
    -Not copying 2 positions of decimal
      -Fixed by creating a new function, but I'm pretty sure this was just
       because I was limiting strncat to 2 places instead of strlen(val) + 1
  -Fixed err_dialog OK mouse being set to absolute value when drawn with a relative value
  
8/29/2024

Finished the exact change buttons on payment screen
Changed placement of RETURN button on recall menu to match cash payment screen

8/31/2024

Fixed bug displaying incorrect charges on order_win
